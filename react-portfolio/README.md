# React Challenge: React Portfolio

## Description
In this challenge, using React I built a portfolio application that highlights my projects and expertise in creating single-page applications.

The portfolio showcases the following page design:

- A header with my name and navigation titles for sections such as About Me, Portfolio, Contact, and Resume, and the title corresponding to the current section is highlighted.
- The about me section displays by default, and includes my photo and a short bio about me.
- The [portfolio section](#portfolio-section) displays cards of the applications along with the title of the project, short description (More/Less links used for readability), link to view the screenshot of the deployed application (projects details are stored in .json file), stack details, and links to the live sites and GitHub repositories. Animation is used when hovering over the card.  Note: for some of the projects a walkthrough video was uploaded as per project requirements.
- The [contact section](#contact-section) displays a form with fields for a name, an email address, and a message. Users receive alerts if they leave form fields empty or input an invalid email address.
- The [resume section](#resume-section) includes a downloadable resume and a list of my proficiencies.
- The footer offers links to my email, GitHub, LinkedIn, and Stack Overflow profiles.
- The application deployed to Netlify.
